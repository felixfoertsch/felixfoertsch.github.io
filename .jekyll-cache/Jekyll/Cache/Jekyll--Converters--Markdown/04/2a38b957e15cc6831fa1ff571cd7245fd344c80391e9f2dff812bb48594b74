I"À<p>I did it! I bought an iPad and an Apple Pencil for christmas last year. I write a lot for my university classes and I didnâ€™t like that I often had to cross out things on paper (because I wrote something down wrong) and had to write them again. I was not sure, if an iPad is the right device for me â€“ but turns out it is. It is awesome. If you make a mistake, you erase it and write it again. Wrong sequence of your sentences? Just move them around. The notes come out awesome.</p>

<p>Additionally I learned a few gestures that are really useful:</p>

  <li>Double tap with two fingers to select sentence.</li>
  <li>Triple tap with two fingers to select paragraph.</li>

<p>While text is selected:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Swipe left/up with two fingers to move left selection handle.</li>

  <li>Tap once with two fingers to exit selection and return to cursor mode.</li>
