I"Ø<p>This semester I finished my course about automata and languages. I learned a lot and it was really enjoyable. From this field, there was <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/atrs4y/pumping_lemma_in_theory_of_computation/">a question about the Pumping Lemma on the computer science subreddit</a>. So naturally, if someone ask about a thing I know about, Iâ€™ll try to explain it as best as I can â€“ repetition is key for retaining knowledge!</p>
