I",<p><a href="https://twitter.com/SnazzyQ">Quinn</a> from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO2x-p9gg9TLKneXlibGR7w">Snazzy Labs</a> just posted an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqjpa8-Cp-s">interesting video</a> about some macOS utilities. I love small utilities, but I like it even better, when a problem can be solved with system functions. That is the case here. He mentions Helium - an app to use a form of picture in picture mode for websites that don’t support the native PIP.</p>

<p>However, there is a better solution!</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>You can use a small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet">bookmarklet</a> that pushes the current HTML5 video on screen into the native PIP. And yes, it also works with Netflix, <strong>if</strong> you are on macOS Mojave (as far as I can tell, Netflix doesn’t run in the previous versions of Safari).</p>

<p>Create a new bookmark, enter the following string as the address, give it a nice emoji (like this: ⤵️), voilà! You can now use the native PIP for nearly all your videos!
Here is the code:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>javascript:document.querySelector(%22video%22).webkitSetPresentationMode(%22picture-in-picture%22);
</code></pre></div></div>
