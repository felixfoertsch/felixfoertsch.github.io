This page provides an overview for my current projects. Not many of them are finished. This page can be understood as a public commitment, since I really want to work on these projects and have to take the time for them.

# [EurKEY](https://github.com/felixfoertsch/EurKEY-Mac)

# [GitHub-Contributions](https://github.com/felixfoertsch/GitHub-Contributions)
I made a new years resolution to work on my coding projects. I am measuring it with GitHub contributions. So I was looking for an app to track the progress. I forked Remi Roberts app and started working on it.
