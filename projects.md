This page provides an overview for my current projects. Not many of them are finished. This page can be understood as a public commitment, since I really want to work on these projects and have to take the time for them.

# [EurKEY](https://github.com/felixfoertsch/EurKEY-Mac)
Every German person coding wonders at one point: why are our squared and squiggly brackets in such a weird position. Yoga for the hands. Steffen Br√ºntjen created a solutions that works really well. I updated it to his specs (v1.3) and released my own, personalized version (v1.4).

# [GitHub-Contributions](https://github.com/felixfoertsch/GitHub-Contributions)
I made a new years resolution to work on my coding projects. I am measuring it with GitHub contributions. So I was looking for an app to track the progress. I forked [Remi Roberts project](https://github.com/remirobert/Github-contributions) and started working on it. But after trying different things, I felt that the code base makes a lot of smaller mistakes (like parsing HTML with a RegEx), is overall not really clean and also was written two years ago for an older Swift version. So I created my own project from scratch to alleviate this problem.
