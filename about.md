Hi! My name is Felix. I have a master's degree in Business Administration and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. My main interests are project management and technology---especially computers and the Internet--and everything connected to these things.

I am currently working as a Junior Java Developer at [BI Business Intelligence](https://www.bi-web.de/) in Leipzig.

## Current Goals

Public commitments are the most motivating. At the moment I am chasing the following goals. If you would like to help me reach them, check in on me and poke me about them:

- ~~Finish my bachelor's degree → _Indicator_: University certificate.~~
    - **Latest Update:** done
- Become a proficient Swift developer → _Indicator_: Deploy one app to each App Store (macOS/iOS).
    - **Latest Update:** Since I am working with Java now, I will postpone this goal.
- Publish as much knowledge as I can on my website → _Indicator_: Publish one useful article every month.
    - **Latest Update:** I have been really slacking with this; I assume that I will encounter new things to learn in my new job and I will try to do write-ups on the interesting topics.

## My Favorite Quotes

Like everyone else, I stumbled upon quotes from famous persons, that stuck with me. Here are a few of them:

- Der Deutsche soll alle Sprachen lernen, damit ihm zu Hause kein Fremder unbequem, er aber in der Fremde überall zu Hause ist. ~ [Johann Wolfgang von Goethe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe)
- [Life is scary. Get used to it. There are no magical fixes. It is all up to you. Go out and start doing the work. Nothing in this world that's worth having comes easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89xUz9fZBXA) ~ Bob Kelso
