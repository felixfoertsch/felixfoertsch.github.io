## [Hello There](https://reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes/)!

My name is Felix. I have a master's degree in Business Administration and I am currently doing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the [University of Leipzig](https://uni-leipzig.de). On the side, I work as a project manager and can help you, to make your ideas a reality.

Since I am a big [Apple](https://apple.com) fan, I am currently learning [Swift](https://swift.org), Apples programming language for macOS, iOS, watchOS and tvOS, to build awesome apps.

## Services on the internet

### Tecspace
[Tecspace](https://tecspace.de) is a hosting provider and domain registrar. I buy and manage my domains through their service. It is extremely cheap, costing only 2,50 EUR per year, if you have 10 or more domains. I love their admin interface. It is simple, behaves like a website should behave (no JavaScript shenanigans) and is very powerful.

### Uberspace
[Uberspace](https://uberspace.de) is a hosting provider. They offer a shared hosting experience that is a little bit more limited than a root server. However, their support is amazing and it's a super good place to host for tinkerers and small projects. Highly recommended. Check out my [Tutorials](/category/tutorials.html) or the [Uberlab for U7](https://lab.uberspace.de) for things you can do on your Uberspace!

**Things I am using on Uberspace**

- [InvoicePlane](http://invoiceplane.com): Simple invoicing software. Offers sending offers and invoices via email, too!
- [Matomao](https://matomo.org): Analytics software to avoid Google.
- [Redmine](http://redmine.org): Amazing project management solution.
- [Syncthing](http://syncthing.net): File synchronisation alternative.


## Software

### Affinity Designer, Affinity Photo (macOS)
[Affinity](https://affinity.serif.com/) produces competitors to the popular Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator: [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/) and [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/) (you can also buy them directly from the App Store). These two programs are *exceptional*. You can do basically everything you can do with their Adobe counterparts, but they only cost 55 EUR each. No subscriptions, no recurring fees. The interface is polished and if you are an Adobe user you will be right at home. Quit Adobe today. Don't let them milk you.

# Quotes

Like everyone else, I stumbled upon quotes from famous persons, that stuck with me. Here are a few of them:

- Der Deutsche soll alle Sprachen lernen, damit ihm zu Hause kein Fremder unbequem, er aber in der Fremde überall zu Hause ist. ~ [Johann Wolfgang von Goethe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe)
- [Life is scary. Get used to it. There are no magical fixes. It is all up to you. Go out and start doing the work. Nothing in this world that's worth having comes easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89xUz9fZBXA) ~ Bob Kelso
