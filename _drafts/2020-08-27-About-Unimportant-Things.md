I just ran into a few inconveniences in my text editor Sublime Text. It stumbles on various Markdown issues which can become annoying. For example when the formatting of fenced code blocks in a specific programming language (in my case Java) bleeds into the rest of the text and stylized it in a way which makes it hard to work with. I decided to give VS Code another go, because it is a *great* editor. And its ecosystem is insane; being backed by the horrible, but vast node.js community.

And then it started. Configuring an editor to personal preference always runs into topics like "Tabs vs. Spaces". These topics consume so much energy, it is actually ridiculous.
