# How to change your life

I was always annoyed by people, who were complaining, but not doing or changing anything about their problems. Complaining about their families, about their jobs - about their life. Everyone knows at least one person like that. I always thought that if they were not happy, they should change something! But since I am a very polite person, I didn’t get in their faces. It would not have mattered anyway, I guess.

And now my life has developed in a way, that I am not happy anymore. And I don’t want to be on the "complaining and not doing anything about it" end. I want to tackle the situation head on. I want to work on my life.

But it is not as easy as you might think. To change your life for the better, it is required to identify what to change, what to change it into and how to change it in the first place. It is necessary to identify what really matters to you personally. Summarised: You need to figure out a plan, that makes you happy in the long run.

And creating this plan can be really intimidating. It requires you to be brutally honest with yourself. Because it might be necessary to change parts of your life, that - at the moment - seem integral to it. It might be necessary to sever ties to people, who are currently very present in your life. It might be necessary to change your deeply entrenched behaviours.

To create this plan, there lies a lot of work ahead of you. It is a time consuming process. Nobody but you can start it. If you are unhappy, the sooner you sit down and work on it, the sooner you can start moving in the right direction.

I decided to start this process. Since plans are basically a list of goals and following a plan means to keep track of your success in reaching these goals, you will need something to write these goals down and track them. A computer with project or goal management software, an excel sheet, word, or a classic notebook. The choice is yours and you should use the tool you are the most comfortable with.

I will be using a very nice classical notebook. I consider this notebook my treasure which holds all the steps to happiness.
