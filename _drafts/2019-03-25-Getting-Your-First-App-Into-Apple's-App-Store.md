You have begun the journey to become an iOS developer. Great! This is an awesome decision. But now what? Where to start? You are in luck! There are many great tutorials out there that will help you get started. It really doesn't matter which one you pick. The important thing is: you have to stick with it for a while. I personally recommend [Hacking With Swift](https://hackingwithswift.com) by Paul Hudson. Start working on the teaching projects and code along. Until you feel like you know enough to start your own project. Then jump. Don't wait too long; don't get trapped in the tutorial trap.

This jump is hard. I guarantee you, that you will experience one thing: getting lost. Feeling overwhelmed. What now? You have that great app idea in your mind. You know exactly hoy it should look. What features it should support. But getting there is hard. Trust me. But it is **not** impossible. You need to be determined.

Even though you think everything is crystal clear, it really isn't -- yet. You will think about a feature and will soon realize: You have no idea how to go from the idea to the working product. Every technology you might need could become a hurdle that is hard to take. And you will also realize: most of the tutorials only teach you the real easy part: how to do some small thing, while imposing heavy constraints. However, the true difficulty in programming is not the coding. If you have a small task that is heavily constrained, everybody can do it.

The hard part about programming is decomposing a highly complex problems into these small tasks that everybody can implement. Your mind will have to work overtime to plant all these new connections and you will get lost. All. The. Time.

This guide will give you a guideline to not stay lost forever and get back on track quickly. It will help you reach the goal of every aspiring app developer: **getting your first app into the app store**.
