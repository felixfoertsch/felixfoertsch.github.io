# Bewerbungen

# C.A.R.
Context: What situation were you in? What background information does the listener need to understand the context? What was the task you were expected to perform? What needed to be done? What challenges did you expect to face?
Action: What actions did you take? (You can also outline what alternatives you considered.)
Result: What impact did your actions have? (These do not have to be all puppies and rainbows. You can admit that you got it wrong on the first try and had to go back and fix something.)

# S.T.A.R.
Situation, Task, Action, Result.
