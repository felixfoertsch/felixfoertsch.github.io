Colors have a big impact on how software looks. Personally, I think macOS and iOS are beautiful and the colors are very well selected. Since I am not a designer, but I want to understand **why** these systems always looks so good, I started designing this website using the Apple colors. The first step I took was creating variables for the Apple colors from the [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/) ([iOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/color/)/[macOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/visual-design/color/)).

I published them on GitHub as gists so you can use them, too. It's just the raw variables; but I could not find them anywhere else in this SCSS form. Read more for the embeds.
