During my time on the Internet, I encountered many things. This post is a collection of the cool things. I will probably update it once in a while. Since I am living in Germany, some of the tips may not be useful for everyone. In order of coolness.

## Web Services

[Uberspace](https://uberspace.de) is a hosting provider. They offer a shared hosting experience that is a little bit more limited than a root server. However, their support is amazing and it's a super good place to host for tinkerers and small projects. Highly recommended. Check out my [Tutorials](/category/tutorials.html) or the [Uberlab for U7](https://lab.uberspace.de) for things you can do on your Uberspace!

Things I am using on Uberspace:

- [InvoicePlane](http://invoiceplane.com): Simple invoicing software. Offers sending offers and invoices via email, too!
- [Matomao](https://matomo.org): Analytics software to avoid Google.
- [Redmine](http://redmine.org): Amazing project management solution.
- [Syncthing](http://syncthing.net): File synchronisation alternative.

[Tecspace](https://tecspace.de) is a hosting provider and domain registrar. I buy and manage my domains through their service. It is extremely cheap, costing only 2,50 EUR per year, if you have 10 or more domains. I love their admin interface. It is simple, behaves like a website should behave (no JavaScript shenanigans) and is very powerful.

[Pinboard](https://pinboard.in) is a bookmarking service. It's minimalistic, easy to use and offers an archiving service so you will never lose these good articles on the internet again.

## Software

### Pictures, Design, Illustrating

[Affinity](https://affinity.serif.com/) produces [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/) and [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/). They are competitors to the popular Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. These two programs are *exceptional*. You can do basically everything you can do with their Adobe counterparts, but they only cost 55 EUR each. No subscriptions, no recurring fees. The interface is polished and if you are an Adobe user you will be right at home. Quit Adobe today. Don't let them milk you.

[Appollo One](https://www.apollooneapp.com/) is a really fast image viewer.

### Random Apps

[Sensei](https://sensei.app/) is a system monitoring app with a nice Mac compliant interface.

[Mactracker](http://mactracker.ca/) is an app that lists all apple hardware and their specifications. No need to google for these things anymore.
