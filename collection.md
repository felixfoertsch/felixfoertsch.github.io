This page is a collection of tips and tricks about things I have learned and found in the past. Since I am living in Germany, some of the tips may not be useful for everyone.

## Services on the internet

### Tecspace
[Tecspace](https://tecspace.de) is a hosting provider and domain registrar. I buy and manage my domains through their service. It is extremely cheap, costing only 2,50 EUR per year, if you have 10 or more domains. I love their admin interface. It is simple, behaves like a website should behave (no JavaScript shenanigans) and still very powerful.

### Uberspace
[Uberspace](https://uberspace.de) is a hosting provider. They offer a shared hosting experience that is a little bit more limited than a root server. However, their support is amazing and it's a super good place to host for tinkerers and small projects. Highly recommended. Check out my [Tutorials](/category/tutorials.html) or the [Uberlab for U7](https://lab.uberspace.de) for things you can do on your Uberspace!

**Things I am using on Uberspace**

- [InvoicePlane](http://invoiceplane.com): Simple invoicing software. Offers sending offers and invoices via email, too!
- [Matomao](https://matomo.org): Analtics software to avoid Google.
- [Redmine](http://redmine.org): Amazing project management solution.
- [Syncthing](http://syncthing.net): File synchronisation alternative.
